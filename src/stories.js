      lifecycle: " ",
      lifecycleDesc: "Before the component comes to existence, it is first called by its parent. For instance, the MainContainer is called by App.js and you can see it in the return statement of render"

      img: "2-builders-plan",
      imgDesc: "Our builders check out the blueprint to establish what tools, materials and crew they are getting already, the materials they need to order and what they are actually building. Let's get to work!",
      lifecycle: "Constructor",
      lifecycleDesc: "Constructor fires up first. It evaluates the props (tools, materials and crew in the analogy), creates initial state (materials to be ordered) and binds functions to the class (this should sound familiar from the OOP JS lecture)"

      imgDesc: "First, you lay down the foundations, build the structure and a scaffolding for yourself",
      lifecycle: "Render",
      lifecycleDesc: "Render evaluates state and props, and returns JSX which is then translated into a DOM node (element) and connects it to callback functions. The render function needs to be a pure function (return the same result for a given input and not cause any side effects), which means that you cannot call setState there. If you do, you'll enter the infinite loop of rerenders because changes in state make the component re-render"

      lifecycleDesc: "Now that your component is already sketched out, you can do whatever you want: go wild with fetching, setting the state, starting a timer, whatever you want. Your app won't crash because you have solid foundations and structure for this kind of a party!"

      img: "6-shouldUpdate",
      imgDesc: "Ooopsie! There was some miscommunication with the HQ and they sent too many foam rolls today. We won't need them but we don't have any better solution for now so we might as well just ignore them altogether and go about our business as we planned.",
      lifecycle: "shouldComponentUpdate",
      lifecycleDesc: "shouldComponentUpdate checks the incoming props and state. In the method definition put a boolean expression that will help the component decide if it's time for a good re
        of it should chill and not jeopardize the app performance with its unnecessary actions"

      id: 6,
      img: "5-updated",
      imgDesc: "Wow, how amazing, this new machinery has finally arrived from the HQ so we can now change how the interior looks!",
      lifecycle: "componentDidUpdate",
      lifecycleDesc: "componentDidUpdate lets you check if the prevProps and prevState are different than the ones that are about to come. That means that you can set a tracker that checks for a specific value of props/state and if so, an action can be performed. This method is useful can be useful when your component needs to be rerendered based on specific changes to props/state"

      lifecycle: "componentDidCatch",
      lifecycleDesc: "componentDidCatch is a miraculous solution for when your app is breaking because e.g. you're trying to map over something that's not an array. This lifecycle method will spot the error and instead of having the whole app crash, it will display a 'something went wrong' page"
